## About the Project

The WeSplit app, developed as part of Day 16's challenge in the "Hacking with Swift" course, is a SwiftUI-based app designed to make bill splitting simple and efficient. It serves as an introduction to the basic structure of SwiftUI apps and demonstrates core concepts in an applied context.

### Features

- **Number of People Selector:** Users can select the number of people to split the bill with.
- **Tip Percentage Selector:** Includes pre-defined tip percentages for easy selection.
- **Per Person and Total Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays the amount each person owes and the total including the tip.

### Learning Experience

This app represents key learnings from Day 16 of the course, including:
- Understanding SwiftUI app structure.
- Building forms, sections, and navigation stacks.
- Utilizing `@State` and `@FocusState` property wrappers.
- Implementing UI controls like `TextField` and `Picker`.
- Using `ForEach` for view creation in loops.
