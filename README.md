# WeSplit2 - A SwiftUI Bill Splitting App

## About the Project

WeSplit2 is a bill splitting app created as part of Day 16 of the "Hacking with SwiftUI" course. The app is designed to make dividing a restaurant bill between a group of people effortless, including calculating tips according to user preferences.

### Features

- **Bill Amount Input:** Users can input the total bill amount.
- **Number of People Selector:** Easily select the number of people sharing the bill.
- **Tip Percentage Options:** Pre-defined tip percentages for convenience.
- **Per Person and Total Amount Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays the amount per person and the grand total including tips.

### What I Learned

Through developing WeSplit2, I gained understanding and practical experience in several key areas of SwiftUI, including:

- Basic structure and lifecycle of a SwiftUI app.
- Creating forms and sections using SwiftUI.
- Implementing navigation stacks and customizing navigation bar titles.
- State management using `@State` and `@FocusState`.
- Building user interface controls like `TextField` and `Picker`.
- Utilizing `ForEach` to create views in a loop.
